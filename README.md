# Live-Chat-Bot
Iâ€™ve recently developed a real-time live chat box using React, Node.js, and Socket.io. This application allows seamless communication by sending and receiving messages in real-time, providing an interactive experience for users. It's been a great project to enhance my skills in full-stack development and real-time web technologies!
